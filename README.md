## 🔒 Security

- **No secrets are committed** — all sensitive keys go in `.env` (gitignored)
- **No external API calls** by default — all AI responses are simulated locally, keeping the app safe to open-source
- **XSS prevention** — user-generated HTML is only rendered where explicitly safe via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on static data
- **No telemetry** — the app makes no external network requests unless you configure an API key
- **CDN integrity** — Font Awesome is loaded with `integrity` and `crossorigin` attributes for subresource integrity
